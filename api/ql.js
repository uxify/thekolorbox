        description:"He is deeply implicated in the humanistic project of articulating the human experience through his choice of materials and creative input. He uses photo ink to render senstitve portraits of this experience. His realistic depiction of people and faces becomes not just about exactitude and craft but also how his particular use of colours  draw out and elucidate the finer nuances of the human condition especially in the margins in his portrayal of children and women. He take on art is said to have a semi-autobigraphical resonance, he is believed to draw from his memories and experiences growing up in rural Orissa to articulate his humanistic view of life at the margins.",

        name:"OINAM DILIP",
        description:"Mr. Oinam, who is currently based in New Delhi, explains he began to feel that there is a need to freely experiment with the cultural and anthropological vibrancy of North East India through his own eyes as he was born and raised in that region. Hence, the current works are inspired by identity-based iconic images, the environment, and tangible cultural objects."
        +"Mr. Oinam has also taken the liberty to differentiate juxtapositions in an attempt to create sensible visual tensions. At times, these attempts arouse questions on associative and representative cultural symbolism. However, his approach to culture is vastly different from the idea of a culturescape as normatively understood in aesthetics. Along the way, he has acknowledged the necessity of displaying variegated hues in a free play of the real and the abstract.",

        name:"PRITTAM PRIYALOCHAN",
        description:"Prittam has a keen interest in the trajectory of visual art in Indian culture over the centuries and its reception and assimilation into our present times. His current works draw from the meticulous ornamentation on Indian icons. He fuses older techniques of ornamentation with his contemporary experiences, where the spiritual connection with everyday life lends him to idolise a cow, elephant, religious figures and re-imagine scenes from a mythic past and factual present. He employs his instincts to connect to the higher spiritual vibration which informs his larger practice.",

        name:"RAHUL CHAUHAN",
        description:"Rahul Chauhan loves to work with vibrant colors and his fascination for bright colors is well-demonstrated through his incredible artworks. The artist tries to create an intimate atmosphere in each of his paintings which allows the viewers to engage directly with his creations. It is in every artist’s capacity to create, but only a few, by the virtue of artistic caliber, evoke a thought, which is conveyed vividly in their paintings.",

        name:"SANDEEP JIGDUNG",
        description:"Assam's Sandeep Jigdung is regarded as a well-known contemporary face of north-east art. Jigdung's works predominantly reflect the experiences of his birthplace. \"My current series characterised by shades of green is a celebration of both nature and human existence\", says Jigdung, yet another student of MFA who's been part of many group shows in and around India. He works closely tie with his experiences of his place and situation.The vivid and dominating greens in his canvas can almost be considered as a tribute to his vision and impression of the North-East. His towering bamboo grooves which seem to dwarf all and sundry in his works are definitive makers of his experience as a young boy growing amongst the verdant landscape of Shillong. His paintings then both testify to his nostalgia for his home and his need to relive through the various motifs, values and motifs that he has culled. Unlike the nineteenth century  scientific drawings of the flora and fauna undertaken by the colonial enterprise which was more to do with control, oppression and training the native, the artists vision in stark contrast offers a respectful and sensitive treatment of nature.",

        name:"TH TOMBI SINGH",
        description:" His contribution to the art scene in Manipur cannot be undervalued or be set in modest terms considering he is the legitimate father of modernist art in Manipur and he is so with penache and a sharp punch. He is not interested in making things pretty but his works carry with utmost honesty and vitality the plague, the contamination in his society. However, the themes that he chooses to articulate and make a point of are drawn from his life in Manipur but they have universal resonances. His works are testimonials to the brutal anguish, oppression and rot manifest in society at large. His modernist renderings of themes that seem to strike a chord with the artist lucidly put forth the artist’s vision. His bold and free strokes are expressive in their very simplicity.",
